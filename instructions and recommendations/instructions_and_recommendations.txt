Update Database so that created column is a "DATETIME" type instead of "DATE"

Please note: HTTPD 2.2 & HTTPD 2.4 have different phrasing.

Recommendations:
-----------------------
CSS Transitions on job rows. Possibly inline delays on opacity so they appear one after the other.
Some kind of loading action, sometime the server couldbe slow.
I turned the refresh button
