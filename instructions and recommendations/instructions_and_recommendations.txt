Database Classes written by Anthony Baker

TESTED on PHP 5.4 and 5.6 systems.

Browser checked on:
-----------------------
Windows 7: IE 8-10, Chrome, Firefox, Opera
Mac OS X: Safari, Opera, Chrome, Firefox
Mobile: Ipad 1 - IOS 5, Iphone - IOS 8

Installation Instructions:
-----------------------

Step 1:
-----------------------
Place in any subdirectory or root level of site.

Step 2:
-----------------------
Update Database so that created column is a "DATETIME" type instead of "DATE"
SQL file in "db" directory has correct structure

Example from command line:
mysql -u USERNAME --password=PASSWORD DATABASE_NAME < job_listings.sql

Step 3:
-----------------------
Update config.php with your database connection info

Config.php document array structure

$env_config = array(
	'db_host' => "127.0.0.1", //or localhost
	'db_user' => "DATABASE-USER",
	'db_pass' => "DATABASE-PASSWORD",
	'db_name' => "DATABASE-NAME",
	'db_port' => "3306"
);

Possible Step 4:
-----------------------
This should not be necessary:

If the AJAX request throws an error most likely:
Directory level overrides are not allowed from an .htaccess file.
This is usually the default on most host providers.

Please note: HTTPD 2.2 & HTTPD 2.4 have different phrasing.

Recommendations:
-----------------------
1. CSS Transitions on job rows. Possibly inline delays on opacity so they appear one after the other.
2. Some kind of loading action, sometime the server couldbe slow.
3. More CSS Tuning for other browsers

Other:
-----------------------
I turned the refresh button into a reset button that clears all queryies.
Implemnted live search
