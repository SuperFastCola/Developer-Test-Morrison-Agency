Create a PHP file that handles all database requests and outputs all data to JSON for use in your Javascript file. This file should:
Connect to your database
Limit all requests to 20 rows
Format a date and time to match the design from the SQL date
Only return rows where all fields are filled in
Handle a simple text search of Title and Company
Handle sorting by particular columns (default sort column is Title)
Return well-formed JSON
Create a Javascript file (and any libraries, if needed) to:
Handle Ajax requests to your PHP file
Bind DOM events for search and column sorting
Append results to the table shown in design
Create HTML and CSS files that:
Are flexible and responsive on the desktop
Use no PHP or server-side code
Additional Considerations:
Please include all pre-compiled files you create, such as LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript, etc
Include recommendations in your execution for improvements to user experience such as real or perceived speed, animations, live search, etc.
Credit 3rd party scripts and their origins.
You are welcome to use your favorite libraries, classes, etc. But avoid adding unnecessary bulk.
Let me know if you have any questions about scope, functionality, or anything else before beginning. Your completed project should include all necessary files and instructions for setup on a local server.

The goal would be to have this complete and back to us by EOW. Let me know if that is doable for you.
